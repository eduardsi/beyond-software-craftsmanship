- Every year Johnny goes to Milton and **begs him for salary raise**:
- He nerviously mentions all great skills he possess and how superior he is to his peers. 
- And believe me, he has a lot of skills.

- The good things about most engineering practices that they are personal and only you decide if to use them. You don’t have to change anyone rather than you. If you know they they are necessary to delight the customer - go ahead. Patient do not dictate Surgeon which practices and tools to use.
- even if they read about “how to make a surgery” online or work in healthcare :)

# You don't need anyone's permission to be professional.
???
- Do whatever you know is right to delight the customer
- The people who are paying you to be a software developer are depending on you to know what you’re doing.
- What about things that require permission and go against boss' beliefs?
- Do not delight your boss. Delight your customers.
- Look:

- Here's how money goes into Johnny's pocket
- Who is stronger than your boss? Customer! Who is boss of all bosses. Whatever customer things right is right.
- Instead of pumping money from Milton (limited budget), Bring money to the company. The more you bring - the valuable you are.
- **if you do not understand how your company makes money, it will cost you a lot**

# Let customer judge

- Johnny folowed the advice and started selling and adding value to the customer.
- TDD silently without screaming about it (peers didn't). 
- it makes him faster and more confident. Not others. Feel the difference.

- "Not everyone is like that" - Johnny's "DONE" always works. "Quick improvements without breaking".
- Customer asks that the most-critical parts of the system are developer by Johnny
- Same day, customer praises Johhnny to top management as the most proactive guy and trusted PoC. 
- Johnny's Deployment automation plan will likely help in their new 1B Unicorn project.

- The more successful you become, the more others will think you are jerk and mushroom. 
- I do not give a fuck. I will conquer the world by being the best.
- You never win a war with a one-man army. You need followers, a fan club (devs, mans, cust)
- So you need to make sure others benefit from your success (macbook!)

# You succeed faster by helping people around succeed.
???
- Instead of focusing on yourself, focus on others! Then others focus on you.
- PageRank: The more people refer to you, the more authority you get. All authority earned by referrers contributes to your authority.

# When you succeed, it is team's success.
## When you fail - it's your failure.
???
- Great idea? Team's idea! Want to praise yourself? Praise team!
- Do not hide your failures behind the team. 
- I FAILED AND IF I FAIL NEXT TIME, IT WILL BE DIFFERENT FAILURE BECAUSE I LEARNED FROM IT. 
- ALL MY FAILURES ARE UNIQUE.

# It Doesn’t matter how “Senior” in the company you are. 
## It's a local measure.
???
- Companies will promote you and pay well for things they need from you. Things that are important for them. More shitty things - more pay!
- Never let any company make you blind and drive your career.
- Many “hands-on” CTO can’t pass mid-level dev interview. Sounds funny, until you find yourself left aboard.

# The only measure of seniority is your freedom.
???
- Freedom to decide what to do, where, when, for what money and whether to do something at all. Everything else is secondary. 
- Stop complaining about less experience peers having more senior title. Stop racing for "titles". It doesn't matter. Freedom is what matters. Freedom will let you set whatever title you want.
