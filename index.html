- You are paid well not to be told what to do. You are paid well because you know what to do. So just do it.

# Let customer judge

- What's important and what's not.

# It Doesn’t matter how “Senior” in the company you are.
## It's a local measure.
???
- Companies will promote you and pay well for things they need from you. Things that are important for them. More shitty things - more pay!
- Never let any company make you blind and drive your career.
- CTO that can't answer simple things. SHITIOS. Slaves of their companies. No way back.

---

# Validate your seniority.
???
- Escape the box you are in
- Attend interviews. I do few times a year, normally abroad (virtual UK phone). Good for you and your employer.
- What is seniority then?

---
class: center, middle
# The only measure of seniority is your freedom.
???
- Freedom to decide what to do, where, when, for what money and whether to do something at all. Everything else is secondary.
- Stop complaining about less experience peers having more senior title. Stop racing for "titles". It doesn't matter. Freedom is what matters. Freedom will let you set whatever title you want.
